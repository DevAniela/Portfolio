        <p><i><q>The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before.</q></i> (Neil Gaiman)</p>
    
        <p>Now that I've quoted my favorite author, let's talk about web development. I found this profession after many years of training for another one, and after finally realizing that performing art was never meant for me. Uncovering the inner workings of a website and how to write code has literally changed my life for the better, which is why I am so dedicated to this craft. I love getting things to work, look and feel just right. And sometimes it can be a challenge to address every detail, but it is always worth it in the end.</p>

        <p>I graduated from the National University of Theatre and Film in Bucharest, where I also completed a Ph.D., so creative thinking and problem solving were always present on my list of transferable skills. Over the years, I've had various jobs, from online English instructor and copywriter to artistic facilitator for hospitals. I have worked alone and I have worked with people, and I love both, preferably when they balance each other out.</p>

        <p>I would love to get to know your project better and help you reach your goals by making sure that your online presence is everything you want it to be and more. Let's have your website come to life!</p>
