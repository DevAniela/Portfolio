<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>My role as an artist in the "Maria Sklodowska Curie" Emergency Children’s Hospital is to plan and implement storytelling sessions, theatre games and musical activities, with a focus on developing creativity and emotional expression. This experience continually strengthens my ability to create an engaging and empathetic environment that is responsive to children’s needs and uses the arts as a means to complement the healing process.</p>
